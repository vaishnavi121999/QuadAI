<h1>QuadAI: Reinforcement Learning & MPC for Agile Drone Control</h1>

<h3>ðŸš€ Overview</h3>

QuadAI is an advanced AI-driven quadrotor control repository, integrating Model Predictive Control (MPC) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) to achieve high-performance, adaptive, and autonomous drone maneuvers. This project explores two state-of-the-art approaches for controlling a 2D quadrotor:

<ul><li>MPC-Based Acrobatic Control: Optimized trajectory planning for executing aerial loops while maintaining stability.

<li>RL-Based Navigation with PPO: Training a quadrotor using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) to reach targets while avoiding obstacles.

<li>Robustness to Disturbances: Adaptive control mechanisms ensuring resilience to external perturbations.</ul>

<h3>ðŸ“Œ Hot Topics:</h3> Reinforcement Learning (RL), Model Predictive Control (MPC), Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), Robotics, AI for Control Systems, Trajectory Optimization.
